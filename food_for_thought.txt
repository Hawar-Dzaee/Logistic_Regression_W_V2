1- In real world scenario, which widget you've control over? 

2- make the dataset as completly seprable [Noise =0] , is the loss function still convex ? why not ?

3- when the there is no nosie [Noise = 0] what is the weight that minimizes the loss function? 
and how does is that relavent to step function?  

4- what does maximum noise mean [Noise] ? how can you interpret it? try to find the optimal weight when Noise =1 ? what's your conclusion ?
